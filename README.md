# Choose a good place to stay in Seattle
Data Science Project One

## Installation
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. 

## Project Motivation
Choosing a good place to stay is one of the most important things we should do when preparing travelling. By using the Airbnb Seattle listings data from 2016, I want to get some tips for choosing good stay.
The tips are based on the following aspects:
1. Which location to choose;
2. Which price range to choose;
3. How to choose property type.

## File Descriptions
There is one notebook available here to showcase work related to the above aspects.

## Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@yuhui6yin/choose-a-good-place-to-stay-in-seattle-985908213626).
